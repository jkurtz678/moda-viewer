Good Boy William ,Spinelicker,"A shapeshifting specimen sculpted in virtual reality and grown digitally. Spinelicker is the first of 6 surreal plants in the ""Ecocistern"" series: a collection of interconnected digital organisms.",https://foundation.app/@willy/foundation/32252,spinelicker,
Good Boy William ,Nature's Course,"A surreal facility where old digital works from unfinished or canceled projects are broken down.

Most digital artists understand the frustration of creating work that never ends up being used. It is a strange feeling to create something that does not exist in our world, that has no physicality and is ultimately a series of hand-crafted 1s and 0s. Many digital artists work commercially to support themselves, creating large volumes of work that are never used and eventually forgotten about. Regardless of how much time it took to create the work, there is no physical reminder of its presence, no moment in which you have to bring it outside and throw it away. These digital objects simply vanish at the failure of a hard drive or a lapse in memory. It’s interesting to imagine the fate of these objects, the futility of having created them, and their not-so-glamorous departure from the digital world. Simultaneously memorialized and meaningless, this piece imagines the surreal void these objects disappear into,

MPkoz,Garden of Forking Paths,"An homage to the 1941 short story by Jorge Borges, ""Garden of Forking Paths"" is a generative painting that exemplifies the infinite possible outcomes of AI-generated imagery. In one reality it stands alone and finite, and in another, it is the first of an unending series. All geometries, movements, and behaviors are procedurally created with code. A custom holographic display hand-made by the artist will be sent to the winner. See examples on the artist's social media. Unique signed 1/1 prints will be sent to any persons bidding over the reserve.",https://superrare.com/artwork-v2/garden-of-forking-paths-29934,garden_of_forking_paths,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1C0DqLNKUt082pRXodANvj009APSOSYqp
MPkoz,Joshua Tree,"“Joshua Tree” is a generative painting, the product of thousands of lines of code and photographs taken on location by the artist. It is an attempt to capture the beauty of this unique region and impart a sense of nostalgia to anyone who has visited.

MPkoz,Perpetuation: Plein Air,"My Perpetuation series continues the theme of traditional methods and genres cast against modern techniques. This piece focuses on the practice of outdoor painting. It is a procedural collaboration with the computer, a painting that's never finished.
The winner will be sent its physical counterpart, a 1/1 handmade holographic display, which showcases the artwork in full 3D without glasses.
See my IG/Twitter (@mpkoz) or site (mpkoz.com) for examples of the physical piece.
