Billelis,YOU INSPIRED ME,"In Memoriam is a tribute to the memory of everyone who is no longer with us today. To the ones who challenged us, created us, held us, helped, inspired, loved, respected, supported and pushed us. This collection is for them. ‘In Memoriam’ encourages you to take a moment to sit in the discomfort of loss and grief, to embody the burden and heaviness of the gap they left in our lives…Because sitting in this discomfort enables us to acknowledge their significance in our lives and to pay respect to all the lessons, love and guidance they have provided to us on our journey thus far. Death is part of a cycle that every living being experiences, and although it is tragic, harrowing and tormenting….on the other side, life begins anew. From death, life blooms. From death we pass on the memories and lessons of those before us and embody their teachings in the essence of ourselves, and the way we show up in the world every day. From death we gain remembrance, gratitude, acceptance, love and healing in life. From death we allow the memory of those lost to become immortal as they live through us and continue to leave their impression upon the world. This collection's purpose is to interpret the heaviness of loss that we have all felt and to give it meaning, to leave a legacy for all they impressed upon us. ",https://niftygateway.com/marketplace/collection/0x8c167a1dbf8e19d18705382d6a457491589f9598/1,you_inspired_me
